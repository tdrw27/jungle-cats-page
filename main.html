        <h2>Big Cat</h2>
        <p>The term "big cat" is typically used to refer to any of the five living members of the genus Panthera, namely the tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard, as well as the non-pantherine cheetah and cougar. However, only the first 4 of these species are able to roar.</p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>The habitat of the Panthera family of felines differs between species. Lions inhabit a wide range of habitats, from open plains to thick brush and dry thorn forest. Panthers can be found inhabiting both marsh and swampland, along with grasslands and even more hostile areas such as deserts and mountains. That is only an exmple of two differing species. Others even inhabit snowy climates and even mountains!</p>

        <h2>Random Facts!</h2>
        <p>
          Amongst the big cats, the lion is the only social animal. While other big cat species have a mostly solitary life in the wild, lions almost always live in groups, called prides, of up to 30 adults and their offspring.<br><br>
          Snow leopards have a long tail that provides balance and agility. They also wrap it around themselves when they rest for protection from the cold.<br><br>
          Jaguars often live near water and are good swimmers. In fact, a jaguar's ultra-strong jaws and teeth can bite through a crocodile skull or turtle shell, but they'll prey on almost anything they come across - including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards.
